### Learning Goals

- Recognize common React Lifecycle methods and when they will be invoked
- Use `componentDidMount` to run make a fetch after the first render
- Use fetch to save data back to the server after an event



### Vocabulary

- Lifecycle Methods 
  - Lifecycle
    - Key moments
  - Methods
    - Function attached to an object
  - That are invoked automatically at key moments during the objects "life-cycle"
  - constructor
    - Invoked first thing when an object is instantiated
  - render
    - Once when the component appears
    - Every time setState is called
  - `componentDidMount`
    - After the very first render
- Optimistic Rendering
  - Update the page before the fetch request
- Pessimistic Rendering
  - Assuming that something would
  - Update the page after fetch request
